# ✅ Presentation Checklist - Loan Approval Prediction System

## 🎯 **Before Your Presentation**

### **Technical Setup (30 minutes before)**
- [ ] **Start Backend Server**
  ```bash
  cd loan-approval-prediction/backend
  python app.py
  ```
- [ ] **Start Frontend Server**
  ```bash
  cd loan-approval-prediction/frontend  
  npm start
  ```
- [ ] **Test Both Servers**
  - [ ] Backend: Visit `http://localhost:5000` (should show API message)
  - [ ] Frontend: Visit `http://localhost:3000` (should show loan form)
- [ ] **Test a Sample Prediction**
  - [ ] Fill form with sample data
  - [ ] Verify prediction works
  - [ ] Check confidence score displays
- [ ] **Open GitHub Repository**
  - [ ] Have `https://github.com/Nadh116/Loan-Approval-Prediction-System` ready
- [ ] **Open Code Editor**
  - [ ] Have project files ready to show
  - [ ] Key files: `train_model.py`, `app.py`, `LoanForm.js`

### **Presentation Materials**
- [ ] **Read PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Complete Q&A preparation
- [ ] **Review QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Key facts and numbers
- [ ] **Study PRESENTATION_SLIDES.md** - 16-slide outline
- [ ] **Prepare sample data** for live demo:
  ```
  Sample Applicant:
  - Gender: Male
  - Married: Yes
  - Dependents: 1
  - Education: Graduate
  - Self_Employed: No
